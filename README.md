## Instructions
 
The final iteration of your project (i.e., Group Assignment 3) aims to worry about design.  You will be in larger groups this time, but the task to be achieved will be larger and more complex.

## History

Version 1.  Initial requirements.

Version 2. (a) Live demos details clarified.(b) Mr. Client removed the need for Bitcoin support (though your design must be extensible to Bitcoin support later!).  (c) Mr. Client also emphasized that the (un)lock mechanism needs to be supported to make the vending machine safe for a technician.

## Requirements


Mr. Client has indicated that other configurations of the hardware will be forthcoming.  Your logic should avoid being too dependent on this specific hardware.

More specifically, the machine must now **support payments through debit cards**, 

~~[VERSION 2 REMOVED:] Bitcoin,~~ credit cards, and mixed modes of payment (part paid via coins, part via credit cards).  [VERSION 2 ADDED:] The design must accommodate easy extension to Bitcoin support.

A **graphical user interface is needed for the simulation**.  This must be implemented through the **Java Swing library**, part of the Java Standard Libraries.

The **configuration panel** must be supported to permit a technician to program costs for the different pop kinds.

[VERSION 2 ADDED:] The **locking/unlocking mechanism** needs to make the system safe for a technician.

All previous requirements not contradicted by the above, are still in place.

## Deliverables

Group:

1. The source code for the logic supporting these requirements.
2. A 2-page document arguing how the design goals have been met.
3. A JUnit test suite demonstrating that your logic has no serious bugs.  This should involve both unit tests and system tests (i.e., when the logic is installed).
4. [VERSION 2 ADDED:] Live demonstration: at least one team member must give a live demonstration in the regular lecture time as described below.

Individual:

A self/peer evaluation.


Teams

Note that different teams are in place: the details are given in this spreadsheet.

## Live Demos

[VERSION 2 MODIFIED:] Each team will give a live demo of their tool to Dr. Walker in regular lecture time on Tuesday, 5 December.  You can revise your solution after this, up to the due date/time.
